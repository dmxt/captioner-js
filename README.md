# How to run (idiot-proof)

1. Download this GitHub in the .zip format
   
    <img width="555" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-04 at 01 51 23" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d229c642-ebe9-47b1-90fd-f2bc60b57bcb" />    
3. Extract the .zip and open the folder
4. Open a file `index.html` with Google Chrome
5. Open console (Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows or Cmd+Opt+J on Mac)
6. Click the "Start Listening" button
7. Speak something, and the transcript will be displayed in the console.
8. Click the "Stop Listening" button to stop listening

## How it works
1. The app uses the webkitSpeechRecognition functionality on Google Chrome. 
2. The transcript is then displayed in the console

### References
The `webkitSpeechRecognition` is a JavaScript interface that provides access to the speech recognition functionality in
web browsers. It allows developers to build speech-to-text applications that can capture and process speech input from
users.
